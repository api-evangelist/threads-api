      Welcome to the Threads API from Meta. This collection contains the [Graph
      API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/) requests to create,
      manage, and publish Threads content, programmatically. For the full
      Threads documentation, refer to the [developers
      documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threads). # Getting
      Started ## Step 1 - Create a Meta App You need to [create a&nbsp;Meta app
      with the&nbsp;Threads use
      case](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threads/get-started#meta-app).
      ## Step 2 - Enable App Users To Authorize Data Access To Your App App
      users must authorize data access for the app you are developing. Ensure
      that proper authorization protocols are implemented to comply with data
      privacy and security requirements. For detailed instructions and
      guidelines, refer to the [authorization
      documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threads/get-started#authorization).
      ## Step 3 - Request an Access Token

      ### API Provisioned Token To request an access token via the API, use the
      requests under the _**Authorization**_ folder within this collection. See
      the [Threads User Access
      Tokens](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threads/get-started#threads-user-access-tokens)
      section in the Threads API documentation for details on authenticating
      your requests. Once you have an access token, you will need to manually
      add the **access_token** header to your requests with this value.

      Note: You can receive an access token for your requests either by using
      the requests under the _**Authorization**_ folder within this collection,
      or by using the _Authorization_ tab above in which the token will be
      provisioned by Postman.

      ### Postman Provisioned Token If using the _Authorization_ tab to receive
      an access token, make sure to include the following:

      - Grant Type must be **Authorization Code** - You must supply the values
      for your Auth URL, Access Token URL, Client ID (your Threads app's ID),
      Client Secret (your Threads app's secret), and Scope.
          
      After these values are entered, you may press **Get New Access Token** at
      the bottom of the page to receive an access token. This access token will
      automatically be attached to your requests.

      ### Access token debugger You can paste any token you generate into the
      [access token
      debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken/) to see
      what type of token it is and what permission you have granted to your app.

      # Limitations Please be aware that certain limitations may apply to the
      API usage. For the most accurate and up-to-date details, we strongly
      recommend referring to the online documentation. Visit the [developer
      documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threads/overview#rate-limiting)
      for more information.

      # Using Variables When using variables in requests (see the _Variables_
      tab above), make sure to **save the updated values** after modifying them
      (e.g. with Ctrl-S / Cmd-S). The values must be saved in the _Variables_
      tab each time they are modified.

      # Autosaving Variables Variable values may be auto-updated and saved after
      a request. For example, when a new Thread is published, the _thread_id_
      field can be auto-updated with the new Thread ID to be used in retrieval
      requests.

      To use this feature, make sure to **set the auto_save_variables variable
      value to true**. Otherwise, variables will not be auto-updated and you
      will need to update them manually.

      # Installation Fork this collection into Postman to start using the
      Threads API. You can generate the code for the API calls in your language
      by following the steps here:
