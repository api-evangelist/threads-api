  Threads is a social media platform specifically designed for close friends to
  share their thoughts, photos, and updates in a more intimate and private
  setting. Users can create group chats, share Stories, and send disappearing
  messages to keep their interactions personal and secure. With customizable
  privacy settings and the ability to categorize friends into different groups,
  Threads allows users to control who sees their content. Users can also easily
  access their Instagram close friends list from within the app, making it easy
  to stay connected with their inner circle. Threads provides a seamless and
  convenient way for friends to stay in touch and share moments with each other
  in a safe and private environment.
